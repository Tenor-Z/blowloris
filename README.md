Slowloris DOS attack utility made in Python

# Overview
The Slowloris Denial of Service Attack is very obsolete nowadays due to a plethora of reasons.
1. Because it only affects the target web server and not the ports or processes running on said web server
2. Website utilities like CloudFlare are able to quickly put a stop to it
3. Technology is mostly designed to migitate this attack.
Unless you understand the web server technology used for the target, and/or understand what it does and what it affects, please do not use this to actually perform a Denial of Service attack.
Besides, this is only for educational purposes only.
